# SRTVTTGather.js

If you:
1. Start with a collection of audio, video, and subtitle files
2. Create an HTML page that contains links to all those files
3. Add SRTVTTGather.js to that page

SRTVTTGather.js will:
1. Loop through all the links and match up subtitles with the matching audio or video
2. Convert SRT to WEBVTT so that subtitles can be displayed
3. Hook up all the links so that a video player with subtitles will open when you click on the links
